The pure, all-American comfort of a freshly-cooked stack of homemade pancakes—it’s a warm and cozy sight, an absolutely heavenly smell and (best of all) one of the most delicious ways to kick off the day. We’re not cutting corners here, so our pancake recipe is designed for perfection over ease. But even the fussiest pancake recipe (and ours is far from the fussiest) is still really quite easy because pancakes are inherently a really easy, humble, forgiving kind of food.

Pat Olivieri lends his name to Philly’s well-known cheesesteak emporium, Pat’s King of Steaks. Thanks to the sandwich-making genius of these brothers (who were originally slinging hot dogs!), we’re lucky to be eating the delicious beef, onion, and cheese on a hoagie today.
